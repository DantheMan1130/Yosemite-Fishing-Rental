# Introduction
This project is a simple web app for the fictional Yosemite Valley Fishing Rental business.  The project was created by Daniel Foster and Vahe Ohanian.

As we are both interested in the outdoors and fishing, we decided to make the web app centered around our favorite vacation spot, Yosemite Valley.  The web app includes information, tables, 
and data for the fictitious business.  We hope it is a clean and well made mock version of a web application that could be put into production with just a few tweaks. 

# Getting Started
1.	Installation process: In the "Code" section here on VSTS, you can download/install the full project to build on your own device (this may or may not work for all systems, we tested 
and the project builds perfectly fine but doesn't load database info.).  The full respository is located at: https://compe561finaldfvo.visualstudio.com/YosemiteFishingRental (here).
2.  Publishing: The project has been published to Azure at: http://yosemitefishingrental20180503034059.azurewebsites.net/ (if an administrator username/password is needed - Username: adminuser Password: Fish987!)
3.	Software dependencies: We used Visual Studio Enterprise 2017 to create this web app.  We cannot gaurantee it will work with any other program/version.  Our VS was updated to most recent 
release as of May 5th, 2018.
4.	Latest releases: The VSTS repo includes the latest app push.
5.	References: The following MSDN tutorials were used as a structure for this project:

# Build and Test
You can play with the app at: http://yosemitefishingrental20180503034059.azurewebsites.net/.  Try creating, updating, and viewing test records!
The app should be able to be built by being saved to your VS project directory and then running the app by clicking "Debug", then "Start Without Debugging".

A PDF document describing the motivation behind our app's design and our brainstorming process, as well as insight into our project's functionality, can be found in this project repository (https://compe561finaldfvo.visualstudio.com/YosemiteFishingRental)
by selecting "Code" in the top menu bar, then "Files" on the drop down.
It is named "YFR_BrainstormingWork".
